          <h1>Field Trip 1</h1>
            <p>This was our first field trip of the term, which took place on the first weekend. We spent most
              of the weekend on the coast, with a couple stops on the other side of the coastal range. Our stops
              were as follows:</p>
              <li>Mary's Peak</li>
              <li>Waldport</li>

            <p>This was our second field trip, which took place on the last weekend of April. We were in Portland
              for most of Saturday, and spent a good portion of Sunday traveling to and at the coast. Here is a list
              of the stops visited:</p>

            <p>This was our last field trip, which took place in the middle of May. We traveled to and from Bend,
            with stops in the city as well as en route to and leaving the area. We stopped at the following
            locations:</p>
            <li>Peavy Arboretum</li>
            <li>Foster Lake</li>

            <p>Our first stop was at Mary's Peak, the highest mountain in the coastal range. Here, we observed
              the type of rock that was present because of tectonic uplift, which was basalt. This gave me a
            more detailed understanding of the physical geography of our state and how seismic activity is fairly
             responsible for the terrain, mainly in the western part of the state.</p>

            <p>At this stop, we visited a small museum that displayed the history of bridges within the state of
              Oregon. This emphasized the importance of transporting across the state and the coast since traveling
              would take so much longer without bridges. A timeline was also given to track the development of bridges
              in the state, along with a side note of the travel time for traveling through the state.</p>

            <p>This viewpoint along the coastal highway reveals a small bay to the right with a strip of the Beach
              separating the bay from the ocean. This was initially formed by part of the ridge splitting the waves
              off into its sides that led to deposition. These conditions allow for good grass growth that
              is useful for farming cattle. This allowed for the formation and growth of the Tillamook industry
              to take place.</p>

            <p>This is a military camp located near Astoria, which was where we spent the night. In addition to
              the camp, there is a small obstacle course comprised of large urban debris, which is used to prepare
              soldiers for navigating through and rescuing others in potential post-earthquake debris.</p>

            <p>This was the site of the winter fort constructed by Lewis and Clark in the early 1800s. A replica of
              the fort is in place for visitors to explore and a brief history of the area, information about the
              local Native American tribes and about the tools used for exploration are displayed. We also watched a
            short video of the history of Lewis and Clark's time at Fort Clatsop, which also highlighted the contrasting
            lifestyles of the Native Americans and expeditioners.</p>

            <p>There were several different types of exhibits available within this museum. Some of them included
              ship design, history of ship use in the Columbia River, the danger of navigating through the river,
              ship use during World War II, and a display of Japanese flags from the war. The "Columbia" ship was

            <p>This place was an area to view the Columbia River Gorge from a high point. We discussed the effort
              made to protect the scenic area of the Gorge by reducing urbanization (primarily on the Washington
              side). This marked the end of the first field trip.</p>

            <p>At this stop, I taught the skill of critiquing maps based on their design using knowledge presented in
              class about map elements and good and bad design principles. I provided two examples of what I thought
              were "good" maps and two that I considered to be "bad" maps, and passed them around so everyone could look
              at them. After everyone viewed them, I asked what made each one good or bad, what design principles were
              used, and how some of the maps could be improved.

            <p>We learned about basemaps and their importance with respect to cartography. Specifically, what information
              should be included or excluded, as well as the design. Like with the previous stop, choosing a good basemap
              is dependent on the map's purpose.

            <p>At Alberta Street, we observed the cultural landscape of the street and the surrounding area. The street
              was very well upkept and modern due to gentrification. However, the surrounding neighborhoods were fairly
              impoverished.

            <p>At this location, we observed the application of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem, or MAUP. Specifically,
              we were divided intov"districts" in a way that the men, who had fewer numbers in class compared to the
              women, had the overallvmajority. This was essentially gerrymandering, an application of dealing with the MAUP.
              While solving the MAUP is used for more complex issues, the simple application of this helped solidify understanding
              the concept.

            <p>Two presentations took place at this spot, which involved the use of compasses. The first one was an activity that involved
              walking in a triangle to three different locations using a compass. The second one involved using a compass to see where you
              would end up compared to not using one given a set of directions for where to walk. Each ending point was expected to be different
              from the other.

            <p>This activity took place on the side of Highway 20 near the town of Eddyville near some rocks formed by erosion. From there, a
              Brunton compass was used to calculate the strike and dip. This is done by measuring the angle the surface of the rock is "dipping"
              or inclining downward and where a perpendicular rock or surface "strikes" the inclined rock.

            <p>At this location, we used basic trigonometry to view and understand the tectonic uplift taking place along the coast. Specifically, we
              looked at a deposited section of fossils along a cliff on the beach and attempted to measure the height of these fossil beds with respect
              to sea level. This was used to observe the rise in material caused by tectonic uplift that can be used to help us better understand the

              we saw the application of the remote sensing presentation on waves, where we learned about the science of waves. In addition, we viewed
              a map of the coast in the Lincon City area, which is a good place for surfing. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of the waves at this
              area is critical.

            <p>For our first stop of the third field trip, we went to the Peavy Arboretum and learned how to examine a section of the forest in
              order to record all of the plant species within that section. Specifically, everyone was split into groups and each group created
              a section of about 3 feet by 1 foot and noted the types of plants within the section. Many of the plants were small, leafy plants,
              along with some ferns.

              historic imagery. The stages of this cycle are growth, conservation, release, and organization. Each of the images revealed
              different stages of the area, in which some notable features included presence of lumber in the town and
              deforestation. Knowing each of the phases ahead of time made it easier to interpret which phase of the adaptive cycle Foster Lake

            <p>At this stop, we used a vegetation classification index to classify the types of vegetation we observed along the trail,

              that was located in the mountains. This was an interesting way to gain a general understanding of the vegetation
              types of an area rather than simply observing it.

              majority of the population in good economic standing, which also has a couple hospitals and
              three fire stations. In comparison, La Pine is much smaller with a lower economic standing among the
              population compared to Bend, and has just one fire station. After discussing the statistics for each
              town, Bend does have more resources for sustainability, but La Pine may have a better network of
              help since it is a smaller community and therefore more connections, which can help the town's
              sustainability.

            <p>For our last stop of the day, we traveled to the Oregon Observatory in Sunriver. We viewed a
              presentation about possibly traveling to Mars, as well as viewing different stars and formations
              in the telescopes. Afterward, we looked at the stars in the sky and identified constellations, which
              are used for navigation for those at sea, which is crucial for knowing where you are headed.

          <h1>High Desert Museum</h1>
          <img src="https://oregonencyclopedia.org/media/uploads/High_Desert_Museum.jpg" alt="High Desert Museum" width="100%" height="100%">
            <p>The main stop of the final day was at the High Desert Museum. Several exhibits were on display, which
              included information on Native Americans, animal navigation, a replica of an old western town,
              and lots of animals that are native to the high desert region found in the Bend area as
              well as a large portion of the western U.S. While there were many remarkable features of the museum, the
              ones we focused on for the presentations were on animal migration and sampling. For animal migration, a
              section of the museum discussed different animals' ways of navigating for migration, which included having
              a knowledge of the magnetic field and a sense of direction, particularly north. For sampling, we discussed
              the basic principles of sampling, with sampling trees on the drive over as an example.

            <p>For our final stop, we took a short hike to the SNOTEL site on the road back from Bend. There, we got
              to see the parts that make up a SNOTEL, such as the plate that measures the depth of the snow, the machine
              that measures the wind, and the station that sends the data to nearby locations for analysis.

            <p>Overall, I got a lot out of this course, in addition to the skills that were presented and taught. I have
              learned more about our state in a way that made me think critically about why everything is the way it is
              in Oregon and the difference that it makes within the realms of physical and human geography. This class also
              reinforced the fact that geography is a very broad field and that while we can focus on one portion of it in
              a deeper way, we can't say that we'll fully understand all of it and it's connections to other fields of geography
              and for everyday life.
